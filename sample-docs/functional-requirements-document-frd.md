# Functional Requirements Document (FRD)

### Project Name: Student Result Management System

***

### 1. Introduction & Project Overview

#### 1.1 Project Summary

The Student Result Management System (SRMS) is a web-based platform designed to help teachers and school staff manage student academic records efficiently. The system provides functionalities to add, update, view, and delete student records while ensuring data security and controlled access.

#### 1.2 Purpose

The purpose of this system is to replace manual record-keeping with a secure and efficient digital solution, minimizing errors and ensuring easy access to student performance data.

#### 1.3 Key Objectives

* Provide an intuitive web interface for teachers and staff to manage student results.
* Ensure data security and restricted access through authentication mechanisms.
* Store and retrieve student information efficiently using MongoDB.
* Offer clear error messages and instructions to enhance user experience.

***

### 2. Objectives & Goals

* Develop a user-friendly, secure platform for managing student results.
* Implement role-based access control for security.
* Ensure data integrity and protection through encryption and authentication measures.
* Provide a seamless experience for users with clear navigation and feedback mechanisms.
* Design an API-based architecture for smooth system interactions.

***

### 3. Functional Requirements

#### 3.1 User Authentication

* **Login & Logout:** Users (teachers and school staff) must authenticate themselves using email and password.
* **Session Management:** Secure user sessions with automatic timeouts after inactivity.

#### 3.2 Student Record Management

* **Add Student Records:** Ability to input student details including name, class, roll number, and marks.
* **Update Student Records:** Modify existing student data when needed.
* **Delete Student Records:** Remove student entries securely.
* **View Student Records:** Retrieve and display student performance details.

#### 3.3 Secure Digital Storage

* Store student records in MongoDB with proper indexing for efficient retrieval.
* Encrypt sensitive data to prevent unauthorized access.

#### 3.4 System Communication

* Implement RESTful APIs for smooth interaction between frontend and backend components.
* Ensure proper error handling in API responses.

#### 3.5 Security Measures

* Restrict access to authorized users only.
* Implement role-based permissions (e.g., teacher vs. admin access levels).
* Encrypt passwords and sensitive data.

#### 3.6 User Experience Enhancements

* Display user-friendly error messages.
* Provide on-screen guidance and tooltips for better usability.

***

### 4. Non-Functional Requirements

#### 4.1 Performance

* The system should be able to handle up to 1,000 concurrent users.
* API response time should not exceed 2 seconds under normal load.

#### 4.2 Scalability

* The application should be designed to scale horizontally.
* Database queries should be optimized for efficient data retrieval.

#### 4.3 Security

* All data transmissions should be secured using HTTPS.
* Implement OAuth or JWT for authentication.
* Maintain logs for all user activities.

#### 4.4 Usability

* The interface should be responsive and work on all modern browsers.
* Accessibility standards should be followed for inclusive design.

***

### 5. Assumptions & Constraints

#### 5.1 Assumptions

* Only authorized school staff will access the system.
* Internet access is required to use the platform.

#### 5.2 Constraints

* The system must comply with educational data protection policies.
* MongoDB is the chosen database solution.
* Development should be completed within the allocated budget and timeline.

***

### 6. Acceptance Criteria

* Users can successfully log in and out.
* Teachers can add, update, view, and delete student records.
* Unauthorized users are denied access.
* Data is stored securely and retrievable within acceptable response times.
* The system provides clear error messages and user guidance.
* The web application is accessible from multiple devices.

***

### 7. Additional Notes

* The application should include a comprehensive user guide.
* Future enhancements may include student self-access to view results.
* Regular backups should be implemented to prevent data loss.
