# ðŸ“¢ Introduction

This wiki is for those who want to learn web technology in their unique style using Node.js. Everyone has their own pace to gain knowledge and develop problem-solving skills. Web technology evolves rapidly, so rigid courses often failâ€”here, youâ€™ll learn by **building projects** in a **gamified internship** at _TechNova Solutions_.

**Your Mission:**

* Earn **TechNova Reputation Score (TRS)** by completing tasks.
* Unlock **badges** and climb the **Intern Leaderboard**.
* Build projects like a developer intern guided by your mentor, **Alex**.
