# üì¢ Introduction

This wiki is for those who want to learn web technology in their unique style using Node.js. Everyone has their own pace to gain knowledge and develop problem-solving skills. Additionally, web technology is evolving rapidly, so a single course structure may not be effective for everyone.

In this wiki, we have listed the best resources to help you in your AI-generated learning path. We have also included time-limited challenges to help you maintain discipline in your self-learning journey.

The most effective learning happens while building projects, so throughout the content of the wiki, you follow an engaging gamified narrative and get to build an application like in a small tech company. On this journey, you will be guided by your virtual mentor, ‚ÄúAlex‚Äù, at our fictional tech company, TechNova Solutions. Within your role as a developer intern at TechNova Solutions, you will learn application development in web technology.
